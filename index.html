    <p>Hello! The topic of this post is how to make the <strong>best</strong>
    peanut butter and jelly sandwich. </p>
    <p>Here are the ingredients you will need:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>2 slices of bread, white or wheat will work</li>
      <li>2 tbsp of peanut butter</li>
      <li>2 tbsp of jelly, any flavor</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Instructions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Toast the bread</li>
      <li>Spread the peanut butter evenly over one slice of bread. Be sure
      to spread it all the way to the edges so there are no dry parts.</li>
      <li>Repeat the previous step, only this time using the jelly on the second
        piece of bread.</li>
      <li>Lay the jelly bread on top of the peanut butter bread, with the spread
      sides facing each other.</li>
      <li>Cut the sandwich <em>diagnolly</em>. This doesn't change the taste
      it's just cuter.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>"That was the best peanut butter and jelly sandwich I've ever had!"
